Create a new branch called f-sql

Sakila Database

Write a SQL statement for each of the following. 

1. Get 10 cities in descending alphabetical order.
select city from city
ORDER BY city DESC LIMIT 10;

2. Get all films with "airplane" in the title.
select * from film
where title like "AIRPLANE%";

3. Get the highest payment amount.
select amount, max(amount) as highest
from payment
group by amount;


4. Get the number of records in the customer table for store id #1.
select count(*) store_id
from customer where store_id = 1;


5. Get all payment records for customer with email address "NANCY.THOMAS@sakilacustomer.org"
select customer.email, payment.payment_id, payment.amount, payment.payment_date
from customer inner join payment
on customer.customer_id = payment.customer_id
where customer.email = "NANCY.THOMAS@sakilacustomer.org";


6. Use a View to get the film info for actor Bob Fawcett.
select film_info from actor_info
where actor_id = 19;

7. Use a Stored Procedure to get the 4 inventory ids for the film "Alien Center" at Store #2.
CREATE PROCEDURE `StoredProcedure` ()
BEGIN
select inventory.inventory_id, inventory.store_id, film.title
from inventory inner join film
on film.film_id = inventory.film_id
where title = "ALIEN CENTER" and store_id = 2;
END 

8. Insert a new store. Ensure that you use TRANSACTION. (This one is possible but it's tough! Pay attention to constraints and the order that you are inserting data.) 

9. Update the timestamp to the current date/time for the new store you entered in the previous question. 

10. Delete the new store.
